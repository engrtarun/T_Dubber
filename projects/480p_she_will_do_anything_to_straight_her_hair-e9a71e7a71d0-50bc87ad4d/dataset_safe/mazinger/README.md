## 🚀 Get Started

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+ and `ffmpeg` on your `PATH` (`apt install ffmpeg` / `brew install ffmpeg`).

### 1. Install

> ⚠️ **Use `uv` — plain `pip` will fail.** `mazinger[all]` bundles packages with conflicting dependency pins that only `uv` can resolve.
> Install `uv` once: `pip install uv`

```bash
uv pip install "mazinger[all]"
```

### 2. Launch the Web UI

```bash
mazinger web --with-ollama --with-coherex
```

A local URL opens in your browser. Paste a video link, pick a voice, and click **Start**. To process several videos in one go, put one URL or local path per line (or upload several files); they run one after another with a progress bar. The flags install a free local LLM (Ollama) and pre-download **CohereX**, the transcription backend Studio defaults to — no API keys required.

> **No Hugging Face account?** CohereX's weights are gated, so swap in `--with-faster-whisper` and pick **Faster Whisper** in the UI — it needs no sign-in and covers any language.

> The flags only move the wait to launch time: if you run plain `mazinger web`, Studio installs Ollama and pulls the model by itself the first time you start a mission with the **Ollama (Local — Free)** provider. Set `OLLAMA_HOST` to use an Ollama server running elsewhere.

> 💡 **No GPU?** Run it on a free Colab T4 in two clicks:
> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bakrianoo/mazinger/blob/master/notebooks/mazinger_colab.ipynb)

> Prefer the command line or Python? Skip ahead to [Common Tasks](#-common-tasks) or the [Python API](#-python-api).

## ✨ What You Get

`mazinger[all]` is a single, GPU-friendly install that includes everything needed for the full pipeline and the Studio web UI:

| Capability | Engine |
|---|---|
| Local transcription — 14 languages + a dedicated Arabic model | CohereX — Cohere Transcribe + wav2vec2 (**Studio default**) |
| Local transcription — any language, no sign-in | Faster Whisper (CLI default) |
| Cloud transcription (no GPU) | Deepgram Nova 3 — $200 free credit |
| Voice-cloned TTS | Qwen3-TTS, OmniVoice (24 languages) |
| Background-audio separation | Demucs |
| Web UI | Gradio (Mazinger Studio), with a chunk-level Editor for finished dubs |
| Local LLM (optional) | Ollama (auto-installed by `mazinger web`) |

> **CohereX needs a one-time Hugging Face sign-in** — the Cohere models are
> gated. In the Studio, open **🤗 Hugging Face → Sign in with Hugging Face**;
> from the CLI, set `HF_TOKEN`. Not signed in, or working in a language CohereX
> does not cover? Switch the transcription method to **Faster Whisper**, which
> needs neither.

Need Chatterbox, MLX (Apple Silicon), or a lighter install? See the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) — `mazinger[all]` now bundles CohereX, which brings the pyannote stack with it (~50 extra packages).

### 3. Fix the dub, chunk by chunk

When a dub finishes, click **✏️ Open in Editor**, or pick any earlier dub in the **✏️ Editor** tab. Each dubbed chunk is listed with its original audio, transcription, translation, and dubbed audio. Correct a word, reword a line that runs long, move a boundary, split or merge chunks, re-dub only what changed, and click **Assemble** to rebuild the output. Nothing re-runs by itself: edits mark what is out of date, and you choose what to redo. See the [Editor guide](docs/editor.md).

## 🛠️ Common Tasks

### Dub a video — auto-clone the original speaker

No voice files needed. Mazinger picks the best 20–60 s of the source as the cloning reference.

```bash
mazinger dub "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" \
    --target-language Spanish
```

### Dub with a ready-made voice theme

16 built-in themes — no files, no profile downloads.

```bash
mazinger dub "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" \
    --voice-theme narrator-m \
    --target-language Spanish
```

Themes: `narrator-m/f` · `young-m/f` · `deep-m/f` · `warm-m/f` · `news-m/f` · `storyteller-m/f` · `kid-m/f` · `teen-m/f`

### Dub with a HuggingFace voice profile

```bash
mazinger dub "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" \
    --clone-profile abubakr \
    --target-language Arabic
```

Available out-of-the-box: `abubakr` · `daheeh-v1` · `3b1b` · `italian-v1` · `morgan-freeman` · `trump-v1` — full list in [Voice Profiles](docs/voice-profiles.md#available-profiles).

### Dub with your own voice sample

```bash
mazinger dub "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" \
    --voice-sample speaker.m4a \
    --voice-script speaker_transcript.txt \
    --target-language Spanish
```

### Output a video with burned-in subtitles

```bash
mazinger dub "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" \
    --voice-theme narrator-m \
    --target-language Arabic \
    --output-type video \
    --embed-subtitles \
    --subtitle-google-font "Noto Sans Arabic"
```

See [Subtitle Styling](docs/subtitle-styling.md) for fonts, colors, positioning, and RTL options.

### Transcribe with CohereX (Cohere Transcribe)

14 languages with word-level alignment, plus a dedicated Arabic model that is
selected automatically for Arabic sources. Included in `mazinger[all]`, and the
**default in Mazinger Studio** — nothing to install separately.

The Cohere models are gated on HuggingFace, so it needs a one-time sign-in. In
the Studio, open **🤗 Hugging Face → Sign in with Hugging Face** and follow the
link it shows — no token to copy. From the CLI, set `HF_TOKEN` instead.

The CLI still defaults to Faster Whisper; pass `--transcribe-method coherex` to
use CohereX there:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=hf_your_token

mazinger dub "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" \
    --transcribe-method coherex \
    --source-language Arabic \
    --voice-theme narrator-m \
    --target-language English
```

> ⚠️ Cohere Transcribe cannot detect the source language on its own. Given one,
> it transcribes confidently in whatever language you name; given none, it
> probes each supported language first, which is slower and less reliable.
> Always pass `--source-language` (or pick one in the Studio).

### Use Deepgram instead of a local GPU

```bash
export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_key_here
mazinger dub "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" \
    --transcribe-method deepgram \
    --voice-theme narrator-m \
    --target-language English
```

### Run a single stage

```bash
mazinger download   "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
mazinger transcribe ./output/projects/my-video/source/audio.mp3 -o subs.srt
mazinger translate  --srt subs.srt --target-language French -o translated.srt
mazinger subtitle   video.mp4 --srt translated.srt -o output.mp4
```

Every stage caches its output. Re-running resumes where it stopped. Full command list in the [CLI Reference](docs/cli-reference.md).

## 🐍 Python API

```python
from mazinger import MazingerDubber

dubber = MazingerDubber(openai_api_key="sk-...", base_dir="./output")

proj = dubber.dub(
    source="https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID",
    voice_theme="narrator-m",
    target_language="Spanish",
    output_type="video",
)

print(proj.final_video)   # ./output/projects/<slug>/tts/dubbed.mp4
```

Full reference: [Python API](docs/python-api.md).

## 🔧 How It Works

Mazinger chains ten resumable stages: **Download → Transcribe → Thumbnails → Describe → Review → Translate → Re-segment → Speak → Assemble → Subtitle**. Every stage runs standalone or as part of the full pipeline; completed stages and individual TTS segments are cached and skipped on re-runs.

See the [Pipeline Overview](docs/pipeline.md) for a diagram and the data flow between stages.
