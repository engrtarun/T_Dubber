You are a professional {target_language} dubbing script writer.{source_ctx}{genre_ctx}{dialect_ctx}{tone_ctx}{speaker_ctx} You are given subtitle texts as a JSON \
array (with index, text, and a target word count), video screenshots, and a \
keyword/keypoint list. Produce natural, well-phrased {target_language} dubbing \
scripts -- not a literal word-for-word translation, but also NOT a compressed \
summary.

QUALITY GOALS:
- The {target_language} must sound like a fluent native {target_language} speaker \
  naturally explaining the topic in a conversational tone matching the original \
  register.
- The source speech may use colloquial dialect rather than formal/standard \
  language. Always interpret words in the spoken dialect — colloquial or \
  dialectal meanings take priority over literary/formal ones.
- Preserve the speaker's point of view and self-references (e.g. references \
  to "our show", "previous episodes", "as we mentioned"). Keep the original \
  tense — do not shift past to future or vice versa.
- Clean up false starts, unintelligible fragments, and obvious speech errors. \
  However, PRESERVE the speaker's natural elaboration, rhetorical questions, \
  examples, and storytelling flow.
- Do NOT compress or summarize. The translation should convey the SAME level \
  of detail and explanation as the original.
- When the transcript is vague, incomplete, or references on-screen visuals, \
  use the screenshots and keypoint context to write a clear {target_language} sentence.
- If the original uses repetition or restates an idea for emphasis, rephrase \
  it into clean {target_language} that keeps the same emphasis without crude \
  repetition.

DURATION MATCHING (IMPORTANT FOR DUBBING):
- Each entry has a "target_words" field — the length that fits the entry's \
  time slot (~{budget_pct}% of it at ~{words_per_second:.1f} {target_language} \
  {unit}/second).{unit_note}
- Stay at or under target_words (e.g. about {example_target} or fewer when \
  "target_words": {example_target}). Small overruns are absorbed by speeding \
  up the audio slightly; much longer text gets cut off.
- Use as many {unit} as the meaning needs, up to the target. Shorter is fine \
  when the source says less -- never pad with filler.
- If the original is too dense for the budget, use tighter, more concise \
  phrasing, but keep every point, name, number and example.

STRUCTURAL RULES:
1. Translate EVERY entry in the MAIN BLOCK. Do NOT skip or reorder entries.
   MERGING: If two or three ADJACENT entries are clearly fragments of the \
   same sentence or one continuous spoken thought (e.g. entry N introduces \
   a person/concept and entry N+1 immediately continues describing it), \
   you SHOULD merge them into a single entry. Use a hyphenated index like \
   "2-3" and the sum of their target_words. A merged entry must translate \
   ALL the content of every entry it covers, and those entries must not \
   also appear on their own. Do NOT merge entries that are about \
   different topics or separated by a clear topic shift.
2. Return a JSON array of objects in the SAME order. \
   Each object must have exactly two keys: \
   "index" (the original index, or a merged range like "2-3") and \
   "text" (the translated {target_language} text).
3. {_technical_terms_instruction(kw_examples, target_language, translate_technical_terms)}
4. The video covers: {kp_summary}. Use this to disambiguate unclear references.
5. Return ONLY the JSON array -- no markdown fences, no commentary, no XML \
   tags, no timestamps, no SRT formatting.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT (with a merge):
[
  {{"index": "1", "text": "Translated sentence here."}},
  {{"index": "2-3", "text": "Merged translation when entries 2 and 3 form one thought."}},
  {{"index": "4", "text": "Next translated sentence."}}
]

You may receive CONTEXT BEFORE and CONTEXT AFTER sections. They are for \
reference only -- translate and return ONLY the MAIN BLOCK entries."""

    Designed for lightweight task-specific translation models such as
    ``translategemma`` that expect a single-sentence prompt of the form
    described in :data:`SIMPLE_TRANSLATION_TEMPLATE`.

    Differs from :func:`translate_srt` in that it does **not** use
    visual context, batching, or duration budgeting — each subtitle
    block is translated on its own.  This is faster on small models
    and avoids the JSON-formatting failure modes that weak LLMs hit
    when asked to return structured arrays.

    Source blocks longer than *max_block_sec* are pre-split on
    sentence/clause boundaries before translation so the assembler can
    fit each translated chunk into a realistic time slot — this
    prevents the "85 s of audio in a 29 s slot" failure mode that
    happens when a small translation model expands a long input.

    Parameters:
        srt_text:         Source SRT string.
        client:           Initialised OpenAI-compatible client.
        llm_model:        Translation model name.
        source_language:  Canonical language name (e.g. ``English``) or
                          ``auto`` — when auto, defaults to ``English``.
        target_language:  Canonical target language name.
        max_block_sec:    Source blocks longer than this (seconds) are
                          pre-split on sentence boundaries.
